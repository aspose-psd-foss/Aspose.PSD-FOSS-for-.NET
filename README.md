# Aspose.PSD.FOSS for .NET

Aspose.PSD.FOSS is a free open-source .NET library for loading, inspecting, editing a small subset of PSD/PSB metadata, and saving the file back without rendering.

This library is for metadata-safe PSD/PSB inspection and limited structural editing. It is not a rendering engine, a raster editor, or an open-source replacement for the full commercial Aspose.PSD product.

## Who This Project Is For

Use Aspose.PSD.FOSS when you need to:

- inspect PSD/PSB structure and metadata from .NET code;
- read layer, resource, color-mode, and merged-image summaries;
- make small safe edits to layer metadata;
- save the file back without rendering pixels.

Do not use Aspose.PSD.FOSS when you need to:

- render PSD/PSB content;
- edit pixels or export raster images;
- interpret the full Photoshop feature set semantically;
- replace the commercial Aspose.PSD API surface one-to-one.

## Common Workflows

- Inspect a PSD/PSB document and read structural metadata.
- Enumerate layers and read their basic properties.
- Change supported layer properties such as name, visibility, opacity, clipping, blend mode key, and geometry.
- Save the updated file back while preserving unsupported sections as raw bytes where possible.

## Mental Model

- The library parses only a small supported subset of the PSD/PSB format.
- Known structures are exposed through a compact public API.
- Image resources are exposed through lightweight unknown-only summaries rather than ID-specific semantic reconstruction.
- Unsupported sections are preserved as raw bytes where possible.
- When you mutate supported metadata, the library rewrites only the affected supported structures and keeps the rest of the file in raw-preserved form.

## Highlights

- Aspose.PSD-style API for common PSD metadata scenarios
- Load PSD/PSB from file paths and streams
- Read document properties: `Width`, `Height`, `ChannelsCount`, `BitsPerChannel`, `ColorMode`, `Version`
- Read additional document metadata: `Size`, `Bounds`, `Compression`, `ImageResources`, `IsFlatten`
- Read layer metadata: `Name`, `Bounds` `Rectangle`, `Width`, `Height`, `Top`, `Left`, `Bottom`, `Right`, `IsVisible`, `Opacity`, `Clipping`, `BlendModeKey`
- Inspect supported official-style resource, channel, mask, and blending-range surfaces
- Change `Name`, `IsVisible`, `Opacity`, `BlendModeKey`, `Clipping`, and layer geometry through coordinate properties
- Save without rendering
- Preserve unsupported sections as raw bytes where possible

## Requirements

- .NET 10.0 SDK or later

## Installation

The package metadata is defined in this repository, but `Aspose.PSD.FOSS` is not published to NuGet yet.

Build the package locally:

```bash
dotnet pack src/Aspose.PSD.FOSS/Aspose.PSD.FOSS.csproj -c Release
```

The package will be created under `src/Aspose.PSD.FOSS/bin/Release/`.

To install it through a local NuGet source:

```bash
dotnet nuget add source src/Aspose.PSD.FOSS/bin/Release --name AsposePsdFossLocal
dotnet add package Aspose.PSD.FOSS --source AsposePsdFossLocal
```

## Quick Start

```csharp
using Aspose.PSD;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Core.Blending;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd;
using Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd.Layers;

using var image = (PsdImage)Image.Load("input.psd");

Console.WriteLine(image.Width);
Console.WriteLine(image.Height);
Console.WriteLine(image.ChannelsCount);
Console.WriteLine(image.BitsPerChannel);
Console.WriteLine(image.ColorMode);
Console.WriteLine(image.Version);
Console.WriteLine(image.Compression);
Console.WriteLine(image.Layers.Length);
Console.WriteLine(image.ImageResources.Length);

foreach (Layer layer in image.Layers)
{
    Console.WriteLine(layer.Name);
    Console.WriteLine(layer.Bounds);
    Console.WriteLine(layer.BlendModeKey);
    Console.WriteLine(layer.IsVisible);
    Console.WriteLine(layer.Opacity);
}

image.Layers[0].Name = "Updated layer";
image.Layers[0].IsVisible = false;
image.Layers[0].Left = 10;
image.Layers[0].Top = 20;
image.Layers[0].Right = 110;
image.Layers[0].Bottom = 120;
image.Layers[0].Opacity = 128;
image.Layers[0].BlendModeKey = BlendMode.Multiply;
image.Save("output.psd");
```

## Choosing Between Aspose.PSD.FOSS and Commercial Aspose.PSD

Choose Aspose.PSD.FOSS if you need a small open-source library for structural inspection and limited non-rendering edits.

Choose the commercial Aspose.PSD product if you need broad Photoshop feature support such as rendering, raster editing, export pipelines, richer resource/tag handling, or wider PSD/PSB compatibility.

## Samples

Runnable sample projects are available in the repository `samples/` folder:

- `Aspose.PSD.FOSS.Samples.Basic`
- `Aspose.PSD.FOSS.Samples.Layers`
- `Aspose.PSD.FOSS.Samples.StructuralEditing`
- `Aspose.PSD.FOSS.Samples.Streams`
- `Aspose.PSD.NuGet.Samples.Basic`
- `Aspose.PSD.NuGet.Samples.Layers`
- `Aspose.PSD.NuGet.Samples.StructuralEditing`
- `Aspose.PSD.NuGet.Samples.Streams`

The `Aspose.PSD.FOSS.Samples.*` projects reference this FOSS library. The `Aspose.PSD.NuGet.Samples.*` projects run the same workflows against the official `Aspose.PSD` NuGet package.

Each FOSS sample must have a fully analogous NuGet sample, and the matching `Program.cs` files must always remain identical. Keep only the project files different so the same application source can be validated against both libraries.

Sample/workflow matrix:

| FOSS sample | NuGet sample | Main workflow | What it demonstrates |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Aspose.PSD.FOSS.Samples.Basic` | `Aspose.PSD.NuGet.Samples.Basic` | Document inspection | Aspose.PSD-compatible document metadata and supported resource/layer counts |
| `Aspose.PSD.FOSS.Samples.Layers` | `Aspose.PSD.NuGet.Samples.Layers` | Layer inspection | Layer metadata, derived geometry, blend mode key, channel information, mask data, and blending ranges |
| `Aspose.PSD.FOSS.Samples.StructuralEditing` | `Aspose.PSD.NuGet.Samples.StructuralEditing` | Supported metadata editing | Renaming layers, changing visibility, opacity, clipping, blend mode key, and geometry, then saving without rendering |
| `Aspose.PSD.FOSS.Samples.Streams` | `Aspose.PSD.NuGet.Samples.Streams` | Stream-based round trip | Loading from a stream, saving to a stream, and working with in-memory PSD/PSB data |

Example commands:

```bash
dotnet run --project samples/Aspose.PSD.FOSS.Samples.Basic
dotnet run --project samples/Aspose.PSD.FOSS.Samples.Layers
dotnet run --project samples/Aspose.PSD.FOSS.Samples.StructuralEditing
dotnet run --project samples/Aspose.PSD.FOSS.Samples.Streams
dotnet run --project samples/Aspose.PSD.NuGet.Samples.Basic
dotnet run --project samples/Aspose.PSD.NuGet.Samples.Layers
dotnet run --project samples/Aspose.PSD.NuGet.Samples.StructuralEditing
dotnet run --project samples/Aspose.PSD.NuGet.Samples.Streams
```

If you do not pass an input file, the samples try to use the repository PSD test fixture.
